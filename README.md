# Mapty Project

The goal of this application to log workouts (running and cycling).

Users can add their workout locations on a map, whether they were running or cycling, and add additional information about their workout.
Mapty utilizes the Leaflet JavaScript library to display maps, and stores the data in the local storage of the user.
